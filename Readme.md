This program is part of the <a ref="https://github.com/victordalosto/infralearning">Infralearning</a> project, an AI program used to evaluate the assets of Road Network.

This <b>AI-Trainer</b> is responsible for training AI Models that can be later used by the <a href="https://github.com/victordalosto/infralearning-evaluate">Evaluator</a> to detect and classificate assets of the road.
<br/><br/>


<h2> How it works </h2>

The evaluaters team simply go to the trainer home page and choose the category that best represent the image on the screen. The choice will be saved in the database.

Later, when the model is beign created by the <a href="https://github.com/victordalosto/infralearning-engine">engine</a>, those classified images are used to train the model.
